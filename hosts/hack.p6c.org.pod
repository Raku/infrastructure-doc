=head1 hack.p6c.org - Perl 6 community server

hack.p6c.org is a community server, with the hardware donated by the
community, and the server generously hosted by
L<noris network AG|http://noris.de/>.

It offers shell access to community members for developing Perl 6 compilers
and modules, running tests and IRC sessions.

=head2 Network

IPv4 address: 213.95.82.54

IPv6 addresses: 2001:780:101:ff00::2:1 to 2001:780:101:ff00::2:9.

(The complete block 2001:780:101:ff00::2:1 to 2001:780:101:ff00::2:ffff is
available for this host, the addresses just aren't all bound to the interface
yet).

=head2 External Services

The following services are in the same physical location as hack.perl6.org,
and thus have both a low latency, and the traffic from and to them is not
accounted. So please use them, unless there's a very good reason.

    DNS         62.128.1.42  62.128.1.53  2001:780:53::1  2001:780:53::2
    NTP         ntp1.noris.net  ntp2.noris.net
    Mirror      http://mirror.noris.net/

=head2 Administration

The following users have root/sudo access, and can potentially help you:

  username      IRC nick
  ========      ========
  moritz        moritz
  duff          PerlJam
  claudio       El_Che
  froggs        FROGGS
  timo          timotimo

The C</etc> directory is manged with etckepper (so essentially a git
repository). Please commit your changes (using C<--author="...">).

=head3 New Users

should be added with

    adduser $newuser
    adduser $newuser users

Group C<users> applies the resource limits (see next section), so it's kinda
important.

=head3 Resource limits

Resource limits (intended to avoid unintential lockups) are configured in
F</etc/security/limits.conf>

=head3 dalek

Dalek is an IRC bot that reports commits to various github repositories on
several IRC channels.

See L<https://github.com/perl6/mu/blob/master/misc/dalek-push.txt> for how to make
repositories push notifications to IRC through dalek.

On hack.p6c.org, dalek runs as two separate systemd services (with services
files in F</etc/systemd/system>): C<dalek-http.service> and C<dalek-irc.service>.

C<dalek-http.service> is a starman server that accepts web notifications from
github. C<dalek-irc.service> is the actual IRC bot. Both run off the source
code in C</home/dalek/dalek/>, as C<dalek> user and group. Both should
automatically start at reboot

You can inspect and manipulate them with the usual systemd commands:

    systemctl status dalek-irc          # status info
    journalctl -u dalek-irc             # get output from dalek-irc
    journalctl -u -f dalek-irc          # get continued output from dalek-irc
    systemctl restart dalek-irc
    systemctl stop dalek-irc
    systemctl start dalek-irc
    systemctl reset-failed dalek-irc    # if 'status' shows it as 'failed'
    systemctl disable dalek-irc         # to stop it from being start at boot time
    systemctl enable dalek-irc          # to re-enable it to be started at boot time

Same goes with C<dalek-http>, of course.

=head3 rakudobrew

The user C<rakudobrew> offers a rakudo installation with some modules. To use
it, C<source /home/rakudobrew/.rakudobrew-bash> in a bash script. This will
extend your $PATH variable to include a C<perl6> and C<perl6-m> binary /
script.

In C</home/rakudobrew/MODULES> is a list of modules that will be installed for
new versions of rakudo. If you need a module added to that list, add it
yourself (if you have the permissions) or ask an administrator to do it for
you.

=head3 doc.perl6.org rebuild

The C<doc.perl6.org> user has an hourly cron job that builds the HTML files
for the L<http://doc.perl6.org/> website. It uses rsync to copy the files
to the www.p6c.org host.
