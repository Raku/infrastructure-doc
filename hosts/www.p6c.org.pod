=head1 www.p6c.org - Perl 6 community web server

www.p6c.org is a community server, with the hardware donated by the
community, and the server generously hosted by
L<noris network AG|http://noris.de/>.

It hosts Perl 6-related web sites, including L<http://perl6.org> and most of
its subdomains (the sole exception being L<http://testers.perl6.org>), as well
as L<http://ecosystem-api.p6c.org>.

The perl6.org subdomains are also available as C<subdomain.p6c.org>. (This was
mostly used for testing the sites before the perl6.org DNS pointed to the
server, but can be (ab)used for other purposes, which require more control
over the DNS).

=head2 Network

IPv4 address: 213.95.82.53

IPv6 addresses: 2001:780:101:ff00::80:1 to 2001:780:101:ff00::80:9.

(The complete block 2001:780:101:ff00::80:1 to 2001:780:101:ff00::80:ffff is
available for this host, the addresses just aren't all bound to the interface
yet).

    perlcabal.org       2001:780:101:ff00::80:2
    design.perl6.org    2001:780:101:ff00::80:3

=head2 Websites

Each (sub)domain that's hosted on www.p6c.org has its own UNIX user, with the
same name as the domain. So for example for L<http://modules.perl6.org>
there's a user C<modules.perl6.org> with home C</home/modules.perl6.org>. In
the home directory there's typically a checkout of the git repository that
contains the sources for the website, and often a script (typically C<update.sh>)
that generates or copies the actual site, e.g. C</var/www/faq.perl6.org/>.

The users's crontab contains a line that calls the script, typically once per
hour:

    root@www:~# sudo -iu faq.perl6.org crontab -l|grep -vE '^#'
    */15    *       *       *       *       cd ~/faq; git pull -qfn; perl generate-web.pl /var/www/faq.perl6.org/

In the case of L<http://doc.perl6.org/> and L<http://examples.perl6.org>,
the cron job runs on the host C<hack.p6c.org>.
